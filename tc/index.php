                    <p>Dated September 21, 2023</p>
                    <p>These terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) for the Fire and Ice promotion (“Promotion”) provided by Guestbookings.com, LLC (“Guestbookings.com”) set forth a legally binding agreement between Guestbookings.com and the purchaser (“purchaser,” “you” or “your”) who purchases products and/or services through Guestbookings.com. Please review these Terms and Conditions thoroughly as well as all terms and conditions and policies and procedures supplied by the provider of any product or service (“Provider”) offered through the Promotion (“Provider Terms”).  To the extent of a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and Provider Terms, these Terms and Conditions shall govern and control. By purchasing products and/or services through the Promotion, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, the <a href="https://guestbookings.com/policies" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, and Provider Terms, which are incorporated herein and you accept these Terms and Conditions on the behalf of any traveling companions, users of any product or service purchased through the Promotion, and/or guests (including minors and those under any disability) (collectively with you, “Customers”). Additionally, you agree that it is your sole responsibility to inform all Customers of the contents of these Terms and Conditions and all applicable Provider Terms.</p>
                    <p>In some instances, both these Terms and Conditions and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service, setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Promotion (in each such instance, and collectively, “Additional Terms”). For example, in addition to these Terms and Conditions, any contest, sweepstakes or other promotion we offer as part of the Promotion or to Promotion purchasers, is and will also be subject to separate official rules and terms (“Official Rules”), which will be posted in the Promotion materials during the applicable promotion period and which will govern Customers’ participation, and our execution, of each such promotion. To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and Conditions and any Additional Terms, these Terms and Conditions will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.</p>
                    <p>The Promotion is a limited time promotion for a special vacation package (the “Package”), which includes a 5-night cruise and 5-night luxury resort stay in Mexico. The Package is not redeemable for cash and is non-transferrable, and valid on new bookings only. The Package cannot be combined with any other offers. All upgrades are based on availability and current fees at time of booking. The cruise and resort stay must be booked within twelve (12) months from the date of the purchase of the Package. Such cruise sailing and resort stay must also occur within eighteen (18) months from the date of the purchase of the Package.</p>
                    <h5>Cruise</h5>
                    <p>Your Package purchase covers cruise fare only with select Providers for you and a guest and includes all regular onboard meals and entertainment. Regular onboard meals are those in the ship’s main dining rooms and buffet locations. Unless specifically stated otherwise in the Package, it does not include taxes, fees and port expenses, gratuities, alcoholic beverages, baggage fees, upgrades, additional guests, travel expenses (airlines, ground transfers), onboard expenditures, and any other expenses not specified as being included. The cruise is subject to the terms and conditions of the cruise line’s passage contract.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, at least ninety (90) days prior to the cruise sailing date, at least 65% of the total price of the Package must be paid. If not, then the cruise will be cancelled prior to sailing and all money already paid toward such package will be forfeited and cannot be refunded or applied to any other balance or purchase.</p>
                    <p>Cruise guests (if purchaser chooses to add a guest to the booking) must meet all eligibility requirements to sail as described on the cruise line’s website as of the date of departure. Any Cruise guest under twenty-five (25) years of age (“Minor Guest”) must be accompanied by a guest who is twenty-one (25) years or older. If the Minor Guest is the child of the purchaser, then such Minor Guest must be accompanied at all times during the cruise by the purchaser. All cruise travelers must have all necessary identification and/or cruise documents (including but not limited to a valid passport, visa, if applicable, and all other necessary travel documents, which include any health certifications/proofs of vaccination that are required by the cruise line and/or applicable governments/ports) required for the cruise. As set forth in more detail in the passage contract, the cruise line reserves the right to refuse to embark any traveler, at any time if, in the sole opinion of the cruise line, a traveler is unfit for any reason for the cruise. The cruise line shall not be responsible for any cancellations, delays, diversions or substitution or any acts or omissions whatsoever by cruise operators or any other persons providing any cruise-related services or accommodations. Purchaser and any guests are also responsible for obtaining travel insurance (and all other forms of insurance) at their option and hereby acknowledge that the cruise line has not and will not obtain or provide travel insurance or any other form of insurance.</p>
